-> About This Project

This repository contains my GenAI Internship Project: AI Code Generator.
It is a Flask-based web application that generates code snippets automatically using AI models. Users can enter a task description, select a programming language, and get optimized, well-commented code directly in the browser.

-> Features

Built as part of my GenAI Internship
Simple and clean web interface (HTML + JavaScript)
Flask backend for handling API requests
AI-powered code generation (OpenAI / Cohere)
Syntax highlighting for better readability
Extensible for multiple programming languages

-> common steps are:

Import Flask + OpenAI
Initialize Flask
Set API key
Define routes (/, /generate, etc.)
Call OpenAI API inside a route
Return the response
Run the app
